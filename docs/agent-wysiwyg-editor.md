# Chainlit + ADK Agent WYSIWYG Editor Concept

This document outlines a proposed approach for wrapping the ADK Web backend and a Chainlit-based frontend into a unified **"build, preview, and deploy"** experience. The goal is to enable non-technical operators to configure agents using a graphical editor while still following engineering best practices such as DRY configuration, centralized secrets management, and repeatable deployment.

## High-Level Architecture

| Layer | Responsibilities | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Admin/WYSIWYG Editor (Chainlit)** | Collect agent metadata, prompt snippets, tool definitions, testing scenarios, and deployment targets. | Build on Chainlit components; persist state via backend API. |
| **ADK Web Backend** | Validates agent definitions, stores reusable components, runs dry-run evaluations, and orchestrates deployments. | Implement REST/GraphQL endpoints secured by OAuth2 or IAM-backed service accounts. |
| **Agent Runtime (Agent Engine)** | Executes deployed agents with versioned configs, centralized secrets, and monitoring hooks. | Recommend Cloud Run or GKE for autoscaling and IAM integration. |
| **Shared Services** | Configuration registry, secret manager, observability stack, artifact storage, CI/CD pipeline. | Prefer managed GCP services: Secret Manager, Artifact Registry, Cloud Build, Cloud Logging/Monitoring. |

## Editor UX Building Blocks

### 1. Agent Definition Canvas
- Modular panels for **System Prompt**, **Behaviors/Policies**, **Tools**, and **Deployment Targets**.
- Each panel saves drafts to a versioned configuration document (e.g., Firestore, PostgreSQL, or Cloud SQL) via ADK Web APIs.
- Provide inline linting using shared validation rules from the backend to keep behavior consistent (DRY).

### 2. Reusable Snippets Library
- Enable product teams to curate prompt snippets and tool templates stored in a central registry (`/shared/prompts/*.md`).
- Editor references these snippets by ID; runtime resolves latest versions, ensuring updates propagate automatically.
- Guardrails can be expressed in Markdown front matter (YAML) to declare required environment variables, IAM roles, or quotas.

### 3. Scenario Testing Harness
- Allow authors to define test cases in Markdown:
  ```markdown
  ---
  id: onboarding_flow
  objective: Validate welcome script alignment
  input:
    user_message: "I forgot my password"
  expected_outcomes:
    - contains: "password reset"
    - metric: latency_ms < 1500
  ---
  ```
- Editor triggers backend dry-run execution using recorded fixtures. Results surface inline with metrics and logs.

### 4. Deployment Panel
- Surface target environments (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`) sourced from a centrally managed configuration service.
- Require selection of a runtime version and config snapshot before enabling **Deploy to Agent Engine**.
- Deployments invoke Cloud Build to package the agent bundle, push to Artifact Registry, and roll out to Cloud Run / GKE with blue-green or canary strategies.

## Configuration & Secrets Management

- Never embed secrets or environment-specific constants inside Markdown. Instead, reference environment variables (e.g., `${LLM_API_KEY}`) that are resolved server-side.
- Store secrets in **GCP Secret Manager** with automated rotation; expose read-only versions to runtimes through IAM.
- Keep shared configuration (e.g., tool endpoints, dataset IDs) in a dedicated `config` service or GitOps repo, referenced by immutable IDs from the editor.

## Recommended GCP Services

| Requirement | GCP Service | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Centralized secrets | Secret Manager | Versioned secrets with IAM-based access. |
| Config storage | Firestore or Cloud SQL | Choose based on transaction/relational needs. |
| Artifact packaging | Cloud Build + Artifact Registry | Automated builds and image storage. |
| Runtime hosting | Cloud Run (serverless) or GKE (custom scaling) | Supports HTTPS, IAM auth, and monitoring. |
| Observability | Cloud Logging, Cloud Monitoring, Error Reporting | Unified monitoring with dashboards/alerts. |
| CI/CD | Cloud Build triggers or Cloud Deploy | Managed pipelines and progressive delivery. |

## Suggested Markdown Schema for Agent Instructions

The editor can expose a Markdown-based schema with explicit sections. Below is a starter template to guide authors:

```markdown
---
id: customer_support_v1
version: 2024-05-01
runtime:
  engine: agent-engine
  image: ${AGENT_IMAGE_TAG}
  environment:
    - SECRET_REF: projects/${PROJECT_ID}/secrets/customer_support
    - DATASET_ID: ${DATASET_ID}
monitoring:
  alerts:
    - latency_p95 > 2000ms
    - error_rate > 1%
---

# Purpose
Outline the primary objectives of this agent and key success metrics.

# System Prompt
```prompt
You are an empathetic customer support specialist...
```

# Behavioral Policies
- Always confirm the customer account.
- Escalate billing disputes to human agent if unresolved after two exchanges.

# Tools
| Name | Description | Invocation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `lookup_user` | Queries CRM by email. | `POST https://crm.internal/api/users` |
| `create_ticket` | Opens Zendesk ticket. | `POST https://zendesk.internal/api/tickets` |

# Test Scenarios
- `onboarding_flow` (see scenario harness above)
- `billing_dispute`

# Rollout Checklist
- ✅ Stakeholder review
- ✅ QA dry-run passed
- ✅ Observability dashboards updated
```

## Pushback & Recommendations

1. **Avoid per-agent hardcoding:** Centralize all endpoint URLs, model names, and secrets. The editor should only reference keys that the backend resolves at deploy time.
2. **Version every artifact:** Track prompt versions, test suites, and deployment manifests. Consider GitOps (e.g., Config Sync) for auditable changes.
3. **Add automated guardrails:** Enforce validation rules (naming conventions, required test coverage) before enabling deployment. This prevents drift and encourages quality gates.
4. **Leverage infrastructure-as-code:** Define Cloud Build triggers, IAM roles, and runtime infrastructure using Terraform or Google Cloud Deploy to maintain reproducibility.
5. **Establish observability standards:** Require latency/error SLO definitions and integrate with Cloud Monitoring dashboards before promoting to production.

By following this structure, the WYSIWYG editor can remain declarative, auditable, and tightly integrated with ADK Web and the downstream agent engine while keeping operations DRY and cloud-native.
