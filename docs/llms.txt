Chainlit ships with adapters for multiple LLM providers. Keep provider credentials in your shared `.env` files and sync them to
GCP Secret Manager so they can be mounted in Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, and Cloud Build without duplication.

Recommended environment variables:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- `VERTEX_PROJECT_ID`
- `VERTEX_LOCATION`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`
- `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY`

Load these via tooling such as `direnv` or `dotenvx` locally. In production, attach the same secrets via Secret Manager or Config
Connector to stay DRY across environments.
