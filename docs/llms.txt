Chainlit ships with adapters for multiple LLM providers. Keep provider credentials in your shared `.env` files (see
[`.env.example`](../.env.example)) and sync them to GCP Secret Manager so they can be mounted in Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, and
Cloud Build without duplication.

Recommended environment variables:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- `VERTEX_PROJECT_ID`
- `VERTEX_LOCATION`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT`
- `AZURE_OPENAI_KEY`

Load these via tooling such as `direnv` or `dotenvx` locally. The
[`scripts/start_local.py`](../scripts/start_local.py) helper reads this
inventory, reuses any values already exported in your shell, and prompts only
for missing entries so the configuration stays DRY. Pass `--non-interactive`
when you want automated jobs to accept defaults while still warning about empty
secrets. Mirror the populated `.env` to GCP with
[`scripts/sync_env_to_gcp.py`](../scripts/sync_env_to_gcp.py) so Secret Manager,
Cloud Build, and GitHub Actions load the exact same credentials without
duplication.
